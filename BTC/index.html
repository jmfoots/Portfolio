			  <h3>Regularly Update your operating system</h3>
			  <p>Keeping your operating system helps patch vulnerabilities that malicious attackers can exploit. Windows Operating Systems typically automatically downloads updates, but you will need to regularly install them.</p>
			  <p>For help updating your operating system visit:</br>

			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab2'>
			  <h3>Enable Firewall Protection</h3>
			  <p>Firewalls provide protection against outside attackers by shielding your network from malicious or unwanted network traffic. Firewalls can also prevent malicious software from reaching a computer via the internet. Firewalls can be configured to block data from certain locations (i.e., computer network addresses), applications, or ports while allowing relevant and necessary data through. <b>Important!</b> It is best practice to only open ports in your firewall for trusted programs and only for as long as you need it open.</p>

			<h2 class='tabs-container__title' id='TabPanelTitle-Tab3'>Antivirus</h2>
			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab3'>
			  <h3>Ensure your antivirus has the latest definitions</h3>
			  <p>An antivirus searches for known malware and attempts to remove it. Update your Antivirus because it is only effective when it has the latest definitions. The traditional antivirus approach based around a database of malware signatures is no longer an effective method of protecting against malware; rather network based approach based on a database of network signatures is a relatively more effective method of protecting against malware by blocking it before it reaches the computer. While using the default Windows antivirus is better than nothing, it is advised to get a more effective antivirus.</p>

			<h2 class='tabs-container__title' id='TabPanelTitle-Tab4'>Password Management</h2>
			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab4'>
				<h3>Create Strong Passwords</h3>
				<p>A unique password for each account ensures that your other accounts remain secure if one of them is hacked.</p>
				<p>Always use two-factor authentication when available to keep your account secure when your password is compromised.</p>
				<p>Use a trusted password manager if you have too many passwords to remember.</p>
				<p>A <b>good, strong password</b> will have these characteristics:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A password that you are comfortable with typing over and over.</li>
					<li>A password that is between 10-14 characters long.</li>
					<li>A password that resembles a short phrase that has meaning only to you.</li>
					<li>A password that uses between 1-3 special characters.
						<ul>
							<li>Special characters can include but is not limited to the following: $, #, *, and !.</li>
							<li>The goal is to balance complexity with difficulty to type.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A <b>bad, easily compromised password</b> will have these characteristics:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A password that uses a simple sequence of numbers such as 123456, 12345, 123456789.</li>
					<li>A password that uses a word or phrase reflecting its purpose such as password, myaccount, notapassword.</li>
					<li>A password that uses a commonly used sequence of letters and numbers such as abc123, asdfg, qwerty, abcdefg.</li>
					<li>A password that includes personal information such as date of birth, name, school mascot.</li>
					<li>A password that has fewer than 10 characters.</li>
					<li>A password that is used for more than one account.</li>
					<li>A password that is stored or written down somewhere.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 class='tabs-container__title' id='TabPanelTitle-Tab5'>Device Security</h2>
			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab5'>
				<h3>Ensure your devices are secure</h3>	 
				<ul>
					<li>Set up a screen lock password/pin on your device to provide a "first line of defense" to against an intruder.</li>
					<li>Use a trusted app to remotely track your device's location in the event it gets lost or stolen.</li>
					<li>If the device is storing sensitive information, enable the remote wipe feature to protect your data in case your lost or stolen device cannot be recovered.</li>
					<li>Update your device and enable automatic updating so it is always running the latest, most secure version of the operating system.</li>
					<li>Manage your apps</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Use only trusted sources for installing apps such as iTunes or Google Play.</li>
							<li>Remove unused apps.</li>
							<li>Monitor what permissions you give your apps because some apps may ask for more permissions than needed.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Backup your data to a trusted source such as Google Drive.</li>
					<li>Be discreet with your devices in highly public or crowded areas.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Use only trusted WiFi sources.</li>
							<li>Avoid sending sensitive information on an insecure network.</li>
							<li>Use a VPN to secure your data on public networks.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2 class='tabs-container__title' id='TabPanelTitle-Tab6'>Email Security</h2>
			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab6'>
				<h3>Think before you click</h3>
				<p>Following these tips will help you avoid potential pitfalls when using email:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you receive an email from an address you recognize but the message is suspicious, contact the sender through another means of communication to verify its legitimacy, such as calling the sender.</li>
					<li>If you received an unexpected email, avoid downloading attachments or opening any links until you verify it as legitimate.</li>
					<li>Never click unsubscribe link from spam emails.</li>
					<li>Beware of fishing emails that have the following characteristics:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The email creates a sense of urgency to follow their instructions.</li>
							<li>The email contains an altered link to a site you know.</li>
							<li>The email is asking for personal information.</li>
							<li>The email is asking you to "confirm" ownership.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>If you were not expecting an email attachment, do not open it until you have verified it is safe.</li>
					<li>Never access sensitive emails from public WiFi.</li>
					<li>Use email filters to keep your inbox clear.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2 class='tabs-container__title' id='TabPanelTitle-Tab7'>File Security</h2>
			<div class='tabs-container__panel' id='Tab7'>
				<h3>Encrypt files containing sensitive information</h3>
				<p>In order to secure that sensitive information, the file needs to be encrypted so that only authorized users can read the file. Encrypted files cannot be read without a special key, such as a password, which is used to authenticate the user.</p>
				<p>Unauthorized access could occur regardless of whether you transmit the file across the internet.</br>
				<b>Beware</b>! There is no easy way to unencrypt a file if you lose the password.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://www.technewsworld.com/story/85718.html" target="_blank">How to Use a VPN for Safer Online Shopping</a></h2>
				<p>With the holidays fast approaching, are you looking to buy presents online?</p>
				<p>The holiday season has become synonymous with online shopping. This isn't really surprising as physical stores usually attract crowds of deal hunters. This often conjures up images of throngs of people waiting in line outside the store, some even camping out. This activity is tolerable for some and even fun for others. However, for many others, it's not worth the hassle.</p>
				<p>Why would it be, when there are perfectly legitimate and convenient alternatives online?</p>
				<p>Well, for one thing, many people shop online without first thinking about their security. Most people are led to believe -- or want to believe -- that all e-commerce sites are secure. This isn't completely true. With so much personal and financial information being exchanged, online shoppers aren't the only ones enjoying the holiday rush -- cybercriminals are too!</p>
				<p>Still, it's possible to add security to your e-commerce transactions by using a virtual private network. A VPN can help you enjoy your online shopping experience without worrying about falling prey to cybercriminals.</p>

				<p>Do you take your online privacy seriously?</p>
				<p>Most people don't. They have an ideal scenario of just how private their online activities should be, but they rarely do anything to actually achieve it.</p>
				<p>The problem is that bad actors know and rely on this fact, and that's why there's been a steady rise in identity theft cases from 2013 to 2017. The victims of these cases often suffer a loss of reputation or financial woes.</p>
				<p>If you take your online privacy seriously, follow this 10-step guide to protect it.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://www.technewsworld.com/story/85661.html" target="_blank">Mobile Phone Security: All You Need to Know</a></h2>
				<p>We rely on our phones to process and store reams of personal digital data. Our digital activities -- from checking bank balances to paying for a product with a tap of the screen, to sending friends and family messages over social media, to accessing work emails remotely -- have turned our phones into a goldmine of personal information.</p>
				<p>It's likely that by 2020, there will be more than 6 billion smartphone users in the world.</p>
				<p>How secure is your mobile device? It's easy to forget that your mobile phone is essentially a pocket-sized computer and that, just as with any device that can connect to the Internet, mobile phones are at risk of a cyberattack.</p>
				<p>The good news is that mobile malware is still relatively uncommon, with the total rate of infections standing at 8 percent. Mobile malware is outnumbered by PC attacks 40-1, as mobiles operate on far more customized systems, and malware must be tailored to a specific system.</p>
				<p>However, mobile malware has been increasing at an alarming rate. There was a 27 percent increase in new mobile malware in the last quarter of 2017, according to McAfee.</p>
				<p>Securing your mobile phone should be a top priority, both for personal and business use.</p>
