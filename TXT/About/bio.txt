~About|My Journey
~I started off making websites for the AISA Technology Fair for a couple years.
In High School, I took the technical endorsement track which included Cisco Networking, CompTIA A+, and Python Programming.
During the summers, I worked at my High School setting up computers, cleaning, and fixing them for the teachers.
After High School, I had already learned HTML, Javascript, Python, DOS, and LUA.
In college, I gained experience in Application Development, Database Management, Network Administration, Digital Forensics, Project Management, Needs Assessment, Information Security, and Multi-media Design.
My goal is to get a local job in the information technology or information security once I graduate.
Specifically, I am interested in automation programming to simplify user involvement and reduce the required skill threshold.
