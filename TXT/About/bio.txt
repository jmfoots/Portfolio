~About|My Journey
~In middle school, I developed websites to enter into the AISA Technology Fair.
In high school, I pursued the technical endorsement track courses: Cisco Networking, CompTIA A+, and Python Programming.
During the summers, I worked at my high school setting up computers, cleaning, and fixing them for the teachers.
After graduating high school, I learned LUA while developing addons and macros for World of Warcraft.
In college, I gained experience in the areas of Application Development, Database Management, Network Administration, Digital Forensics, Project Management, Needs Assessment, Information Security, and Multi-media Design.
My goal is to get a local job in the information technology or information security fields once I graduate.
Specifically, I am interested in automation programming to simplify user involvement and reduce the required skill threshold.
